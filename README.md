House price prediction - Linear Regression Multiple Variables
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model with multiple variables to predict house prices. The model takes into account various factors such as the area of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the age of the house to estimate its price. The notebook guides you through the process of data preparation, model creation, and training, followed by evaluating the model's performance. This practical example serves as an excellent foundation for understanding the basics of machine learning and how to apply it to real-world problems."
